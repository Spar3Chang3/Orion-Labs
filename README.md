# Orion Labs

This is a repo for UIS's Orion Lab, which should become a website there eventually.
This is created by students, and is now on its way to be the official website!

To check out a live demo, please visit [Orion Lab](https://uisorionlabs.web.app/)

## Instructions for Building:

Try not to pay much attention to the build and deploy files, those are specifically for Firebase.
Instead, you'll want to have Vite and SV installed through `npm`. Once that's installed, simply run:
`npm run build`

The repo is preconfigured for static serving (The free tier for Firebase) so Svelte's own routing should take over from a normal serve.

Alternatively, you may run `npm run dev` for the preview of the website. Both work, but build simply builds the files into the `build` directory.
