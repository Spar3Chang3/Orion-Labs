We are Orion Lab. A dynamic and creative space where students, faculty, and innovators come together to tinker, build, and bring their ideas to life. More than just a computer science club, Orion Lab fosters an environment that encourages experimentation and hands-on learning, allowing individuals to dive into their own projects with the freedom to explore new technologies, solve complex problems, and push the boundaries of innovation.

Our mission is simple: provide a collaborative, resource-rich environment where members can pursue their passions, learn by doing, and share knowledge with one another. Whether you're interested in coding, hardware, robotics, game development, or anything in between, Orion Lab is the perfect place to develop your skills and ideas. We believe that learning thrives in a space that encourages creativity, exploration, and the application of theory into real-world projects.
